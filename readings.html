				<p><strong>As we may think</strong> reading response:</p>
				<p>The author talks here about the future of science after the war. He poses the question on whether or not science would have a future in a peace<br> driven society by bringing an example of the physicists who have been making nuclear bombs all through the war and asks if they would<br> have any jobs since there would probably be no more jobs in making nukes.</p>

				<p>He is concerned that science has been converging too much toward violence and less towards helping people. This essay was written during <br> the Hiroshima nuclear bombing, which brought up a lot of questions about the destructive nature of science.</p>

				<p>He argues in his first section that science has evolved a long way since the first invention of science but our methods on viewing its results<br> and interpreting them have stayed the same for generations. In this way, one may think that the author is insinuating that human <br>creativity is the element that has not evolved and on the contrary, it has become more prone to violence. Creativity feeds science and science <br>feeds creativity. If you are missing one of those there is no way that the scientific method can evolve more then what it is today.</p>

				<p>In the second part, he discusses the concept of having all of human writing combined in a small room thanks to microphotography.<br> Here we may think that he is debating on the idea of the online encyclopedia.</p>

				<p>Today we have Wikipedia which everyone can edit and add text on whatever they want such as a specific animal, Sherlock Holmes, cross<br> correlation, and the history of chocolate. He envisioned a future where we could have something like that thanks to photography, but we realized<br> his idea with computers and the internet. He also envisioned an algorithm that could search the entirity of human knowledge using a few short<br> words which would be called the Memex. He was trying to describe the first information search engines which would make information available <br>to people who do not have access to the library. Nowadays, search engines can even create the information that he was hoping<br> people could eventually rapidly access.</p>
			
				<p>Tim Berners Lee's <strong>The world wide web</strong> reading response:</p>

				<p>In this article Tim Berners Lee describes the advantages of the World Wide Web over other established web frameworks such as Gopher <br>and WAIS. The idea of the WWW was that information could be easily linked to another website or page via addresses sent between computers. These <br>addresses, in turn, could be searched up and displayed in a browser on a computer. By doing this, the web's information could be more easily <br>accessible and also more interlinked so users wouldn't have to manually search for every individual page. Also, the WWW gives a standard for all <br>web pages to use, so distribution and creation of information on the web would be more streamlined and easier for everyone to<br> access. In addition, the ability to transfer rich media such as pictures and files makes HTTP a very easy way to disseminate rich information.</p> 

				<p>The advantage of the WWW is that it made the access of any information an activity that any user could do without super advanced knowledge<br> of how computer systems worked. This led to the web being not only an academic thing, but a household thing. It also made the web interesting,<br> because entertainment, news and data could be accessed at any time with little effort. </p>
